# console-based-2-player-combat-game
Basic console based fighting game with Python 3

Game Logic:
This game will be played by two players in a turn-based manner. In each turn, one of the player’s hero will attack the other player’s hero. An attack may be successful by a certain chance rate. If an attack is successful, the attacked player’s health points will decrease by the magnitude of the attack which will be decided by the attacking player. The first player whose health points become zero or negative will lose the game. Initially, each player’s hero will have 100 health points. The game will continue in a turn-based manner until one of the players lose.
